# Arduino-Python-Volume-Control
**Arduino Volume Mixer** is a project that uses an Arduino and Python to control Windows volume. A potentiometer sends data via serial port, and the Python script adjusts the system volume in real time. Simple and functional, it combines basic hardware with software to create an interactive audio control.
